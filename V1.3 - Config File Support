With the newly-released and revised Version 1.3 of my very first File Cleaner, this introduces support for an external config.json file, allowing behaviour to be changed without modifying the Python code.

This makes the tool safer, more flexible, and suitable for non-technical users.

New features include:

1. External configuration via config.json
2. Safe defaults if the config file is missing or invalid
3. Configurable cleanup rules without editing cleaner.py

With the script for the Configuration File, the script will automatically load settings from config.json if it exists in the same directory as cleaner.py

If a file was missing or cannot be read for reasons to be explained, the script will then fall-back to its built-in default settings and log the event of what went on.

For example, the following text below explains what the general script would be inside of the config.json file being used as support.

{
  "days_old": 30,
  "dry_run": true,
  "exclude_files": ["cleaner.py", "cleanup_log.txt"],
  "exclude_folders": ["quarantine"]
}

The key configuration options that myself (Zain) needs to remember are the below:
Key	Description

days_old:   Minimum age (in days) before a file is eligible for cleanup
dry_run:    If true, previews actions without moving files
exclude_files:   List of filenames to always ignore
exclude_folders:  Folder names that should never be processed

Safety & Reliability

1. Files are never deleted
2. All actions are logged to cleanup_log.txt for documentation on all past ran events
3. Dry-run mode can be enabled at any given time
4. Invalid or missing configuration files do not cause crashes

After looking at this myself and seeing why this all matters, I thought about this... separating configuration from code leads to:

1. Reduces human error
2. Allows safe changes in production
3. Makes the tool easier to maintain and reuse for multiple clients
