The File Cleaner that I had previously made before now includes a "Dry-Run Mode" to safely preview changes before any files are moved.

When enabled, the script will proceed to:
- Scan files based on the configured rules
- Print what "would possibly" happen
- Move nothing at all

This allows verification before activating the cleanup script.

### How to Use Dry-Run Mode ###

In `cleaner.py`, set:

DRY_RUN = True

Run the below in PowerShell or Command Prompt
python cleaner.py

The output should potentially read like the below:
[DRY RUN] Would move: report_2023.txt -> quarantine/report_2023.txt

If Dry-Run mode needs to be switched off, change the code for DRY_RUN to the below:
DRY_RUN = False
